I started to code in 2016 with Minecraft, where i wanted to write my own server plugins in Java. 
After quite some time i had some projects to code an own client like LabyMod with some nice and neat Features in-game.
With GitHub friends of mine and i started to code clients together and always wanted to have not only the best looking, but also best working clients.
Because of our financial problems back then, we didnt have the opportunity to release everything to the public. Some more friend used the clients and were quite happy.
Back in 2019 i started with Kotlin by converting and recoding all my code from Java to Kotlin as a practice. This helped me a lot for learning Kotlin, which i decided to use as the main coding language for the next time.
Almost the whole year 2020 i didnt have a bigger project, but i tried to write a jailbreak tweak for iPhones, which worked quite good. But i lost interest in that quite fast, because i couldn't jailbreak my iPhone.
Last year in February/March i started again and tried to write an own app, but failed at realeasing it in the AppStore because it's about 100$ per Year, which was a bit too much for me at this point.
In between i always played some video games, maybe a bit too many. 
When i was 14 i received my own Arduino and tried to build smaller projects at home.
Later in 2019 i bought an Raspberry PI, which is currently working as my own Web-Server.
In the last time i transfered my project from Swift to HTML and PHP to release as an WebApp. The progress is good so far. 
In school we started with Python and i think my knowledge and experience i gained by using Java for some time before helped me a lot.

Basically that's all i have to tell about my experience with coding and computer in general.

Thank you c:
